scammed
not 2
bruh @roultitude the exam is at 3
or we'll all get 0
luckily someone told me
thank u for reminder then
hmmmmmmmmm
yes
they uploaded a new circular
is this gea
where's this from?
FYI, if you need any ideas on what EDA to do for Grp Proj part B, open your data in excel and click 'Data Analysis'
that I have not been paying attention to
is this GEA project
Gini coefficient?
Like
the what
i'm having trouble finding recent gini coefficient stats
anyone started on the economy reading critical reflection?
open book but not open internet
all assessments were restricted on examplify
Is midterms open Internet
nop
They don't even need you to collect data?
literally a longer tutorial question?
So it's
but since u have 3-4 people u can just split the questions so it shouldnt take more than 1-2 hours
u kinda just read a research paper that they pick for u then answer some prompts
if ure interested in what it would look like
some of the question wordings will be ambiguous so u gotta watch out for those
its pretty free if u can get through some of the traps the setters lay down
yush
especially if you took stats in sec/jc. Then it's just revision
but u can do it within 5 mins
midterms is like a 10 mcq test that they give 30mins-1hour for
this mod is busted
yeah i just realised
its like a short assignment that u do in a group
the project is pretty low effort though
not yet
Did they reveal any details in tut?
theres a proj???
oh shit
zzz
I thought just finals or smth
like group project and midterms
wdym?
This mod is more effort than I thought
hi
hello
u can only make them hold data
if u have multiple event classes
ok basically:
and the whole point of having events is to abstract the logic behind them?
to hold data
i only have 1 event class
not seperate ones
isnt that what the wording of the question hints at
cuz ur event gens other events right?
why not
u can't seperate into event classes
as in
as much
i guess codecrunch told me
do this
u cant
i did this as well
dude
how even
its the circle of life
wtf
everything is a cyclic dependency?
what does
bruh
CS1231S haunts
i love my TA
- my TA

Some possible topics & question types as seen in PYP:
- Design some classes following OOP principles (Understand Inheritance, abstract class, interfaces)
- Type (inference/erasure/generics) and understanding of overriding vs overloading
- Stream operations (map, filter, reduce, flatmap)
- Lazy vs Eager evaluation
- Some sort of code tracing
I think might be good to review the recitations. Other than that just manage your time well and don't get stuck at earlier(but tricky) questions. All the best:)

Some final reminders for PA2 tmr:
- Please be on time
- In terms of the solution, don’t over complicate things. The data structures involved will typically not be that complex, so array, arraylist, maybe hashmap. Could be mostly your own custom classes, but it usually will not require you to use things like priorityqueue or Enum etc. Read the question and decide carefully.
- Expect the usual requirements and constraints, i.e. immutability and OOP, again read the question!
- Unless stated in the question, DONT use ArrayList<Object> or Object[]!!! If you need to suppress warning because of type issues that are not mentioned in the question, you are probably doing it wrong
- Manage your time well, don't get stuck and waste all the time in one level.
- You are allowed to bring your iPad (if u want) this time (not to be used as a communication device ofcos)
- If you are able to connect to the monitor in the lab, we will allow that, so come early to set it up.
See yall

On 13 April 2021, it was reported on Channel News Asia that a former civil servant will be charged under Official Secrets Act over the leaking of COVID-19 case numbers last year (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/civil-servant-official-secrets-act-leak-covid-19-case-numbers-14614470). Based on the ethical views in Chapter 1, which of the following ethical views considers the actions of the former civil servant ethical?
what dis qn
in which case i would say he didnt do his job honestly and responsibly hence why it is not contributing to society
Does leaking the numbers constitute a virtuous act? personally i do not think so
cause from what i interpreted as the main principle behind contributing to society is that one contributes to society if they do their work honestly and responsibly
erm yea
what was your ans? contributing to society?
why is question 9 none of the above?
there's recitation??
Took a shit
I is coming
@enigmatrix
@akash
attending recitation?
u not
garbage in, garbage out
=.=
no lol
so do u still rmb ur answers?
wait
so even making 10mcq/week is difficult for our esteemed prof
INTeresting
someone msg me on tele asking for my last sem ans
wtf are the qns same as last sem
hmm ok
if u guys go diff ans for qn 7 and 10 do highlight cause me and troy are bit iffy on those 2
i havent started
Quiz 2
Q1. None of the above
Q2. None of the above
Q3. Identifying the individual from a set of anonymous data
Q4. For many consumers who bought an Apple device, they were told that Apple TV+ was included free for one year when you purchase and activate an Apple device before 30 June 2021. The service was automatically activated on successful activation of the Apple device on a user's account. Consumers may cancel their free subscription at any time before the one-year period was up, otherwise, their subscription would be automatically renewed for another year at S$6.98 per month. Apple was adopting an opt-in policy for this offer of free 1-year subscription.
Q5. In Singapore, the use of face recognition by the government to detect and punish people who violate COVID-19 mask-wearing requirements in MRT trains is ethical under Natural rights as all people in Singapore are expected to cooperate with the government on terms all accept, and abide by the rules of society, even if they do not like these rules, as long as they choose to continue to be in Singapore.
Q6. None of the above
Q7. None of the above
Q8. Freedom from intrusion
Q9. None of the above
Q10. Natural rights
yes
Last min check to make sure everyone has submitted
cause there is vagueness in the statement which would allow a different interpretation
ok i dont disagree with you, but i am still leaning to my original ans
i dont disagree with your logic and i have no counters, but let me spend some time thinking about it a bit more
^
with me or not
wait so do u agree
but yes i am taking
no lah i just anyway whack one hor
i assume ur taking is1103 wizard
not to the right holder
positive right is referring to others
so like here
A positive right is a right to be subjected to an action of another person or group. ... In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder.
whats with those reacts......
You sure qn 8 is none of the above? why is it not "Negative rights gives the individual the right to do anything without interference, while Positive rights imposes an obligation on the individual to do or not do things based on the individual's role in the community."
nice
A+ buddies

the moment i update it i will update u

its a ethics textbook bro
Is the textbook not enough to come to a conclusion?
only anyhow read the book

side tip if u wanna be unethical: if u email smth and get a answer, dont share with the IS1103 tele grp, can maintain bellcurve
u kinda need to email the prof a lot
then memorize most of it
my advice: copy paste the 1st chapter somewhere

@everyone 
BBB HackkyTon is over! 
We will be launching the bot in multiple waves today. 
For now, go to #mod-select  and react the mods you are currently taking
@everyone 
Lets make a new disc bot for hw-reminder-take-2
News finally publicly out
In the event of an attack
"Run, Hide, Tell"

RUN
-Move quickly and quietly away from danger using the safest route
-Do not surrender or attempt to negotiate

HIDE
-Stay out of sight, be quiet and switch your phone to silent mode
-Lock yourself in and stay away from the doors

TELL
-Provide information to the Police by calling 999, SMSing 71999 or using the SGSecure App
-Provide details about the attackers and their location
Be Vigilant

Look out for articles left unattended in public places, especially those with the following characteristics:
Have excessive usage of securing materials
Have stains or discolouration and/ or emit an unusual odour
Have wires sticking out

Look out for persons showing suspicious behaviours and characteristics:
Wearing bulky or oversized attire that may conceal hidden objects
Placing an object or parcel in a crowded area and departing immediately
Attempting to hide/disguise their identity
Loitering for an extended period of time at one location
Taking photos or doing video recordings of security features
Asking specific questions concerning the security of a place or an individual without a reasonable explanation

Also look out for signs of radicalisation from those around you:
Expressing the belief that violence is justified
Idolising, showing support or sympathising with terrorists and their causes
Trying to influence others to support terrorism and/or participate in terrorist activity
Displaying insignia or symbols in support of terrorist groups
Look out for suspicious vehicles:
Commercial or heavy vehicles being operated erratically, at unusual times or in unusual locations, particularly near crowded areas
Vehicles circling an area repeatedly, or on different occasions
Any vehicle abandoned abruptly by the driver
Overly weighted vehicles with sunken tires and suspensions
Vehicles with foreign objects attached

How to report suspicious activities or behaviour?

If you have any information about suspicious activity or behaviour:
Call the Police at 999
SMS 71999 if you can’t talk
You can also submit information to the Police via the SGSecure mobile app
Provide clear descriptions to the Police.

Those with information on a person who may be radicalised can also contact the ISD Counter-Terrorism Centre hotline at 1800-2626-473.

Be Prepared. Our Response Matters.

Alert: Global terrorism is on the rise
Global terrorism is on the rise and Singapore is facing our highest level of terror threat in recent years. A terror attack is not a matter of if but when, and we cannot afford to remain complacent.

The Home Team has been stepping up our fight against terrorism and more resources have been committed to strengthening our security forces. But the Government's effort alone is not enough. To safeguard our way of life, everyone has to play a part.

The SGSecure national movement is Singapore's community response to the threat of terror. It aims to sensitise, train, and mobilise our community to prevent and deal with a terror attack.
Every one of us can do our part by doing the following:
Stay Alert:  Community Vigilance
Keep a look out for and report any security threat.
Remain vigilant after an attack.
Stay United:  Community Cohesion
Build stronger community ties and safeguard Singapore's racial and religious harmony.
Stand together both in peacetime and after an attack.
Stay Strong:  Community Resilience
Learn how to protect ourselves and those around us if caught in an attack.
Help each other to bounce back quickly after any incident.
@everyone Let's all do our part to make Singapore the safest country in the world!
https://www.sgsecure.sg
Hi! I have just been upgraded to v2, looking forward to working with you all from now on!
If you want to mess around with the bot, go over to bot commands and type:
League stuff:
!bestchamp
!fuji_fanservice
!balancedchamps
!trashchamps

Fun Stuff:
!alexa
!mycap
!headpat

Audio:
!earrape
!stopaudio

Use the bot in the #legebot channel to decide on a 5-stack for League of Legends. 
To start the poll use:                               !poll
To stop a poll prematurely use:            !stoppoll
To extend the poll time use:                 !extendpoll

If you do not see the #legebot channel and would like to play some league with us, message @ratrising and you will be assigned the league role. (This is tentative till i actually code it in the bot lmao)

and moved on
I wrote HAND
It's ok 
If I didn't know how to do a qn
hmm yes sucked out

what came out was instead
it didn't come out
-_-
also just note this in case come out LOLOL
Nevermind, my next choice of exam bonus question will be: who is standing next to Android in the picture I showed in my lecture.
?????????????????
i dont understand a single shit from the last 3 lectures
eh this tin lok really confusing the shit out me
also SU
new morning new start
😢
/cry
cry
so its some funky corner case
i pass the public test case
def is_peak(n_cases_increase_avg, n_adj_entries_peak=7):
  m = n_adj_entries_peak
  ds = n_cases_increase_avg
  adj = int((np.count_nonzero(np.isnan(ds), axis=1) / 2)[0]) # should be same number of nan for each country

  avg = np.nanmean(ds, axis = 1) # ignore nans
  # avg = np.mean(np.nan_to_num(ds), axis=1)
  windows = np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view(ds[:, adj:-adj], m*2 + 1, axis=1)
  peak = np.max(windows, axis=2)
  part = ds[:, adj+m : -adj-m]
  peak = np.bitwise_and((part > 0.1 * avg[:, None]), np.equal(part, peak))

  peak = np.pad(
    peak,
    ((0,0), (adj+m, adj+m)),
    'constant',
    constant_values=((0, 0), (False, False)))
  return peak
the only thing i think can make my code go wrong is too many NaNs
it seems like a simple problem tho
can i see ur code?
im gonna hope he drops hints on his private test case
u done with this?
making me angery

I was right ;)
I guessed
nop
coursemology shows u the expected output for private test cases?
wait
Compared to np.floor
Is cuz // of negative numbers does not round properly
too many text
and just assumed it was
i saw the graph in the pdf
its not moving average LOL
The private test case jn
i realized
yea
Which gives correct ans
Window average
Our current is actually
hm
That was my initial soln
Convolve doesn't work for >1D
its just convolved average
cant
its not moving average
i realized i misunderstood the qn
np.convolve
try
np.array([list], dtype=np.float64)
def average_increase_in_cases(n_cases_increase, n_adj_entries_avg=7):
  #[[1,2,3,4,5],[23,34,5,67,7,3]]
  a = np.cumsum(n_cases_increase,axis = 1)
  a = (a[:,n_adj_entries_avg:-n_adj_entries_avg] - a[:,:-2 * n_adj_entries_avg]) / (n_cases_increase*2 + 1)
  return np.insert(a, (0,) * n_adj_entries_avg + (a.shape[1],) * n_adj_entries_avg , np.nan, axis = 1)
np.OP(x)
int(N)
i have some random meeting now 💢
gimmelike 30 min
return [[A[r][c] + B[r][c] for c in range(len(A[0]))] for r in range(len(A))]

it sounds like
no
Coding heavy mod
Does it sound like a
not that bad
no only pso2
no one playing poe?
only features to keep ppl out
there are no bugs
xD

of the word
he isnt lvl 30 yet
in both senses
I just started
whats ur ign
come play with carnation and i
whats ur name
current year 6
@Wyrkx who are u
surely you jest; no one has even got close to the skill i have to get iron
kappa
I'll probably get there without even trying
i wanted the legendary iron  status and failed
wow u have a smurf
never ranked before
on my smurf
he hasn't ranked at all in like years
and i placed bronze 1
i tried hard
i tried
how did you place iron 1
howww
its op cuz its a secret
its kinda like the secret op u know, if its not a secret then it may not be op
then i will have used my ignite and flash for nothing
is if they sidestep my q aa
wdym the only thing i fear
the 200iq
wo
to get them real low
remember dark harvest
and they will die
i flash q and ignite
how long did it take you to master teemo adc
i take ignite and go bot
its op
i go teemo adc with lich and nashor every game
is teemo op
ama for iron 1
i am dumb dumb boi
i just know in that class
no lah
is ur CS1010E class like this as well
i will know who to blame
if in future people's debugging skills are limited to checking the spelling of variable names
^
like maybe if IDEs are somehow not allowed for the quiz then sure
literally run it and colab will literally spell it out for u
or both
people are blind and dumb
ITS ONE LETTER
i mean
yes and no???
i mean
theres 3 problems exactly like this
well now u know why the module is like that\
yknow whats the kicker
o.o
i mean i dont think i know what the problem is
like yes its an intro to python but cmon
.........

you're illegal
Jk
illegal maths
∫u(x)v'(x) dx = u(x)v(x) - ∫u'(x)v(x) dx
∫u v dx = u∫v dx −∫u' (∫v dx) dx
more practise
wait act its better isnt it
i thought i was done
noooo
tut4 got even more qns
geh
its normal its just that the ppl with 16-17 marks arent shown
bruh 4 ppl do not give a fk
mhmmm yes very normally distributed
prof chan
"slowly easing into a normal distribution"
"knowing what you are graphing out" basically
The trap here is to specify at the start which extremum you're looking for and why
And also note that by picking an arbitrarily high y intercept and drawing a segnent through it and the given point

Your initial ladder length can be as long as you want

Just that it might get stuck if it is above the calculated min
I see what u mean
hmmmmmm
:thonk:
So any length below your calculated min can clear the corner, any length above cannot clear
Cos no matter how long yoyr ladder is, if it cant clear the min possible length round the corner its stucj
OHH lol no you need the minimum what
if u graph it out the point we get is a minimum point, rather than a maximum point
cuz I think we both have the wrong idea about this question
Honestly looks correct
diff method? Same answer
Wait I got same thing tho
i go sleep
the graph looks fucked
my entire thing is prolly wrong
BAH
nvm lol i figured it out
this is my sad working so far
not so straightforward
Show me!
the last question i need GC/Matlab alr
yall tried tut 4 yet
bruh
i got a 0 for the exam
guys i think im gonna fail 1101
is as it ended
first message of this channel
clap
easy
i dont get
wtf
rn
wtf am i hearing nr

if i was on that
hes more fit than me
holh fk
wait wtf tht was him in the video?
it do be like that
the prof himself
when participant count is 1
and end of module
where does the exponential decay plateau at tho
ikr
why the strings in this module so fancy
need ans
is alr diff
if by name
i mean
shh
by name
how the ppl he called
i dont like
exponentially decreasing student count
over his
i dont want him to mald

kinematics/dynamics???
whats covered?
All lectures and tutorials will be conducted via live Zoom sessions. Laboratory sessions will also be conducted face-to-face. Both tests will be conducted online with Zoom proctoring
tutorials are not graded
We are not superman/superlady. Sometime and somewhere in our life journey
we will need help

2040c channel
discrimination
why is there no 2040c channel
rip
woah they were there?
😭
they are now removed
shit, did u all manage to download the prev tutorial sets from the workbin
safe
the 2040s quiz is piss weak
encapsulation for data
abstraction for behavior
but qn 2 is basically like
its not that hard
im done with lt2
https://nus-sg.zoom.us/j/85064356889?pwd=RndHajdIL1RtQkRXNHB4Z3FjQjZjZz09
sure
alrite
ok

// Part 1: Bit output seems to repeat after (size + tap) bits. However, it seems to be inconsistent on some inputs.

// Part 2:

public int[] createPassword(String str) {
    return str.chars().flatMap(n -> convertBits(n)).toArray();
}

public IntStream convertBits(int i) {
    return IntStream.range(0, 8).map(x -> (i >> x) & 1);
}

// then, somewhere else: shift.setSeed(createPassword("TheCowJumpedOverTheMoon"))

// Part 3:
With various values of tap, there do not seem to be too much of a difference (~10%), other than tap = size - 1.
e.g.
for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
    ShiftRegister shift = new ShiftRegister(8, j);
    shift.setSeed(new int[] {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0});

    int n1 = 0, n0 = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        int o = shift.shift();
        if (o == 0) n0++;
        if (o == 1) n1++;
    }

    System.out.printf("Tap(%d): 0 = %d, 1 = %d\n", j, n0, n1);
}

gives output:

for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
    ShiftRegister shift = new ShiftRegister(8, j);
    shift.setSeed(new int[] {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0});

    int n1 = 0, n0 = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        int o = shift.shift();
        if (o == 0) n0++;
        if (o == 1) n1++;
    }

    System.out.printf("Tap(%d): 0 = %d, 1 = %d\n", j, n0, n1);
}



        ShiftRegister shift = new ShiftRegister(8, 6);
        shift.setSeed(new int[] {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0});

Also it's 2273 so our coding is only to problem solve
And other functions
No cos if y'all got a python code snippet of random junk I could use it to learn all the syntax at once
o.o
Kek
we can smurf on ur 1010
we r cs students
just ask us
Lol just curious cos I have to learn python now
/**

        r.setSeed(seed);
        /
          An Error should be thrown here, since the provided tap is longer than expected seed size

        r.shift();
        r.generate(4);

React if you want to play after finals::
I have miktex installed but no packages UWU
so :/
my 'local' toolchain is just miktex
I still rather use overleaf than setup a local toolchain kekw
it's very hard to modularize it but still retain QoL features like previewing output
so now since SAO has like two separate parts
i see what u mean
ah
ye
if you compile section1 alone it doesn't create PDF cos you don't have \begin{document}
when you modify section1 you have to go back to main.tex and recompile that to see the output
if you make a separate section1.tex and \input{section1}
yeah like when I was doing ARP and wanted to separate segments
this is stitching multiple .tex?
my latex is just one .tex file
woah whats these used for
😦
I'm not a CS student why the hell do I need pygment
so I have to separately compile 3 diff projects then assemble it
right now there's no flexibility in how to separate compilation steps within each proj
even has proper support for pygments
standard stuff is alr sufficient
y u wanna change compile step
they don't let you configure the compile step tho
I only use overleaf if I need to legit typeset stuff
wordtex is faster uwu
but google drive
which is basically latex
i use overleaf
I used WordTeX
fkn chad
akash did the entire 2001 in latex
bro
my first asgn had a mistake but I still got 30/30
you typeset in latex?
sad
oh
😦 23/30
he noticed
else -4 for my assignment
i hope he doesnt notice
i forgot to use f_{uv}, used f_uv instead
